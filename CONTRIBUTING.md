Important:

    input data should be put into the "input_data" folder, but have the file(s) ignored by git (use gitignore); I would suggest passing the files via WeTransfer or similar. I have the Kratos and FeFlow; please share the OpenFoam results

    report files are created in the "reports" folder

    for testing out new developments please use the main file call "python3 evaluate_results.py"

    for evaluating all (with mode calculation on and default nr of blocks = 6) call "python3 evaluate_results.py --calculate_mode True --run_test False"
