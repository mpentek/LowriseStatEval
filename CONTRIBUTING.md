Important:

    input data should be put into the "input_data" folder, but have the file(s) ignored by git (use gitignore); I would suggest passing the files via WeTransfer or similar. I have the Kratos and FeFlow, here is the download link; please share the OpenFoam results
    report files are created in the "reports" folder
    for testing out new developments please use the main file call "python3 evaluate_results.py Test" (maybe even setting inside the "evaluate_results.py" file "calculate_mode = False"
